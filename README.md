Step 1: Download the zip file at https://data.transportation.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Border-Crossing-Entry-Data/keg4-3bc2/data. Note that this file was downloaded from Data downloaded from https://data.transportation.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Border-Crossing-Entry-Data/keg4-3bc2/data on March 20, 2019, and included all variables for all years and saved as a CSV. 

Step 2: Uncompress and open in Microsoft Excel. 

Step 3: Parse the location variable. {  =clean(a:a) -> paste values only -> text to columns -> find and replace }

Step 4: Create a discrete year variable with insert, filter and fill 

Step 5: Create a variety of pivot tables to generate findings. Which border has more crossings? What specific port is the busiest? How do the ports in NY compare? What considerations do we need to give considering the nature of the "measures" variable?
